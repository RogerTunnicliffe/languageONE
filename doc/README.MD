# Installation

Because languageONE is assembler code the installation comprises of downloading the system (really just a bunch of text files) 
and beginning  your programming. 

# Reference

The languageONE manual, in .odt/.doc/pdf/html formats is included in the download. refer "doc/languageOne.*"

# Testing

for each release of languageONE a test program is provided, being V1.16.ONE, V1.17.ONE, V1.18.ONE etc.
With each new release the previous programs released will have been optional modified but definitely retested
Testing is considered complete for each version, when all prior test programs perform as expected

# Contributers

Currently, languageONE has a single developer. As is, it is a hobby, and there are no expectations other than that
